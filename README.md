# AutoSauce
**The Ultimate Claude Code Framework**

---

## Overview

AutoSauce is the evolution of [CCPlugins](https://github.com/brennercruvinel/CCPlugins), rebuilt from the ground up to leverage Anthropic's latest capabilities.

With native subagents, enhanced context memory, and improved SDK features now built into Claude Code, AutoSauce focuses exclusively on what the CLI still cannot do efficiently.

## Development Status

Currently in active development. This repository serves as preview and development workspace for AutoSauce V2.

**Production-ready version:** [CCPlugins V1](https://github.com/brennercruvinel/CCPlugins)

## Design Principles

**Eliminate redundancy.** Only implement what Claude Code cannot handle natively.

**Architecture over commands.** Focus on framework design, not individual slash commands.

**Senior developer efficiency.** No handholding, no verbosity, just results.

## Background

CCPlugins reached widespread adoption with 24 professional commands for Claude Code CLI. However, recent Anthropic updates made several commands obsolete as the CLI now handles them natively.

AutoSauce represents a complete rethinking of what a Claude Code framework should be.

## Timeline

Release date to be announced.
